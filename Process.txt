=> Model: robust machine-learning model
=> Approach:
	-> Gathering the Data: Kaggle
	-> Cleaning the Data: label encoder
	-> Model Building: Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier
	-> Inference


-> Import the important library
-> Try to understand the data and clean
-> Then if need you can do encoding
-> After ten split the data to evaluate the model
-> Now building the model then evaluate the model depend on the test and train data
-> Now finally fit the model with whole data then try the final prediction with test data
->
